# UFOs

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive webpage where users are able to view reported UFO sightings across the United States and filter the findings table to match their preferences.

# Results
in order to use the search engine built into this site, users need to apply their preferences into the search filter on the left side of the page. Users are able to filter the page based on the date of the sighting, City, State, Country and the shape of the sighting. the image below shows the full content of the page before any filters are applied.

# Summary

One drawback of this page is that the user is required to enter the filters for the search exactly as they are shown in the table. Entering keywords that do not appear in the table would result in an error and would not display any results.

To improve the user experience, a drop down menu can be implemented where the user is able to choose from the given list. The date filter should also provide the user with a calender like feature where they can choose the date as oppose to entering it themself.
